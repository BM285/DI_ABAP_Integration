# Deep Dive 2 - Calling an ABAP function module in SAP S/4HANA from SAP Data Intelligence

In this Deep Dive, we will demonstrate how to create a custom ABAP operator in SAP S/4HANA and trigger its execution from a Pipeline in SAP Data Intelligence. The ABAP operators are developed in the S/4HANA system as normal development objects, hence, they can be transported within the system landscape.<br>

The basis for the integration with SAP Data Intelligence are the ABAP Pipeline Engine in SAP S/4HANA and the ABAP Subengine in SAP Data Intelligence, both linked with either an RFC or a Websocket RFC connection.

After a new ABAP Operator has been created, it can be used immediately in the SAP Data Intelligence Modeler by leveraging its dynamic ABAP Integration operator. These operators in SAP Data Intelligence are actually shells that point to the original implementation in the connected S/4HANA system.

There are two variants of this operator available in Data Intelligence:
a. SAP ABAP Operator: This can be used with any ABAP operator delivered by SAP (in namespace `com.sap`). Examples for out-of-the-box operators are (the already known) ABAP CDS Reader, ODP Reader, SLT Connector, Cluster Table Splitter (for Business Suite systems), and the ABAP Converter. 
b. Custom ABAP Operator: This can be used with any ABAP operator created by customers (in namespace `customer.<xyz>`).

In order to use the ABAP Subengine, the following prerequisites have to be met:
1. A supported ABAP system is available (see availability matrix below)
2. The ABAP system can be reached via RFC or WebSocket RFC (HTTPS is still supported but will get deprecated soon)
3. A user with the necessary authorizations (see SAP Note [2855052](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2855052)
4. An RFC or Websocket RFC connection has been created in the Connection Manager.

For SAP S/4HANA systems greater than 1909, you are good to start â€“ no installation required.<br>
(You can also run this scenario with a SAP Business Suite system, but then it is required to install the (non-modifying) DMIS add-on on that system.)<br>

ABAP Operators are created in the ABAP System by implementing the BAdI: `BADI_DHAPE_ENGINE_OPERATOR`.<br>
The BAdI implementation consists of a class with **two methods** that must be redefined. It is recommended that the BAdI implementation extends the abstract class
`cl_dhape_graph_oper_abstract`.
- GET_INFO: Returns metadata about the operator
- NEW_PROCESS (with its local class `lcl_process`): Creates a new instance of the operator.

`lcl_process` uses a simple event-based model and can be implemented by redefining one or more of the following methods:
- ON_START: Called once, before the graph is started
- ON_RESUME: Called at least once, before the graph is started or resumed
- STEP: Called frequently (loop)
- ON_SUSPEND: Called at least once, after the graph is stopped or suspended
- ON_STOP: Called once, after the graph is stopped

After completing these steps you will have created...

1. Click here.


2.	Insert this line of code.
```abap
response->set_text( |Hello World! | ). 
```



## Deep Dive 2.2 - Integrate the custom ABAP Operator in a SAP Data Intelligence Pipeline

After completing these steps you will have...

1.	Enter this code.
```abap
DATA(lt_params) = request->get_form_fields(  ).
READ TABLE lt_params REFERENCE INTO DATA(lr_params) WITH KEY name = 'cmd'.
  IF sy-subrc <> 0.
    response->set_status( i_code = 400
                     i_reason = 'Bad request').
    RETURN.
  ENDIF.

```
