# Deep Dive 1 - ABAP CDS View based data extraction in SAP Data Intelligence

As a matter of fact, it was neither possible to make the ABAP Development Tools (ADT) available for the participants of this virtual hands-on workshop, nor is it feasible to provide a SAP GUI. For this reason, this Deep Dive section is presented by the trainer live in ADT and the SAP GUI connected to the underlying SAP S/4HANA system.<br>
<br>
The documentation in this section is intended as guidance for you to reproduce the described steps in your own environments later on.<br>
It is **not a part** of the hands-on exercises!<br>
<br>
<br>
ABAP Development Tools (ADT), formerly known as "ABAP in Eclipse", is the integrated ABAP development environment built on top of the Eclipse platform. Its main objective is to support developers in todayâ€™s increasingly complex development environments by offering state-of the art ABAP development tools.
