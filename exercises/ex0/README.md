# Overview and Getting Started

The idea of ABAP Integration is to establish a unified model to consolidate all interaction scenarios between SAP Data Intelligence and an ABAP-based SAP system (directional and bi-directional).

The primary use cases for ABAP integration in SAP Data Intelligence are metadata retrieval, data provisioning, and functional execution.

This Deep Dive and Hands-On Session concentrates on the uses cases of **ABAP Data Provisioning** and **ABAP Functional Execution**.<br><br>

**1. ABAP Data Provisioning**<br>
Getting access to and using real business data in an SAP Data Intelligence pipeline helps you to build new intelligent applications and data flows.<br>
For example, you may want to obtain the replication data from an SAP S/4HANA system, enrich the data in an SAP Data Intelligence pipeline, and then feed it to a target storage in the cloud.<br>
The ABAP data provisioning gives you access to SAP S/4HANA and allows you to consume ABAP CDS views directly in a pipeline. ABAP CDS is the semantically rich data model in SAP S/4 HANA and allows the consistent representation of a business object (such as a business partner). It is feasible to just get this data in an initial load, but also to have a stream approach established to consume every update, insert, and delete that happens in the SAP S/4HANA system.<br>For details about what options you have with the different release levels and release combinations, see [SAP Note 2830276](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#%2Fnotes%2F2830276).

**2. ABAP Functional Execution**<br>
In certain scenarios, it is required to enhance the scope of a data-driven application by accessing and writing data into an SAP S/4HANA system. For example, it may be necessary to execute a function module or BAPI within a pipeline to read data into SAP Data Intelligence, post information into an ABAP-based SAP system, or trigger an execution in the remote system. If you require this type, you can now create your own operator in SAP Data Intelligence that references the corresponding ABAP functionality. You can find a list of all available operators in the ABAP section of the [Repository Object Reference for SAP Data Intelligence](https://help.sap.com/doc/d131eca2150049da86c541ee0895177c/Cloud/en-US/cloud_loiod131eca2150049da86c541ee0895177c.pdf).
